Module 1: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

In this module, we’ll cover the basics of ethical hacking, the hacking phases, and essential 

terms that you need to know to embark on your journey as a Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH). 

What is Ethical Hacking? 

Ethical hacking refers to the process of intentionally probing a system for vulnerabilities in a 

controlled, authorized manner to identify weaknesses before malicious hackers can exploit 

them. The main goal is securing systems, not compromising them. 

Why Ethical Hacking is Important 

Identify vulnerabilities: Protect systems from real hackers. 

Prevent data breaches: Guard sensitive information. 

Strengthen defences: Ensure that the system is fortified against attacks. 

Types of Hackers 

White Hat Hackers: Ethical hackers who work for the good of the system (you, the ethical 

hacker). 

Black Hat Hackers: Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal gain. 

Gray Hat Hackers: Hackers who may sometimes cross legal lines but without malicious 

intent. 

The Phases of Hacking 

Ethical hacking follows a systematic process, known as the ethical hacking lifecycle. Here 

are the main stages: 

1. Reconnaissance: 

 The hacker collects information about the target system. 

 This can be active (direct interaction with the system) or passive (gathering info from 

public sources). 

2. Scanning: 

 This phase involves identifying live hosts, open ports, and services running on the 

system. 

 Tools: nmap, netdiscover. 

3. Enumeration: 

 Extracting detailed information such as user accounts, shares, and services. 

 Tools: enum4linux, snmp-check. 

4. Gaining Access: 

 The hacker attempts to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities to gain access to the 

system. 

 Tools: Metasploit, Hydra.


5. Maintaining Access: 

 Once access is gained, the hacker may create a backdoor for future entry. 

 Tools: Netcat, Metasploit. 

6. Covering Tracks: 

 The final phase is about erasing logs and traces to avoid detection. 

 Tools: Clearev, Rootkit Hunter 

For Real-World Hackers: The Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK Frameworks 

As a hacker operating in the real world, you know that cybersecurity is more than just tools 

and commands—it’s about strategy, precision, and understanding your target. Two critical 

frameworks that every hacker should master are the Cyber Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK. 

These frameworks break down the art and science of hacking into structured phases, giving 

you the edge in understanding and emulating attack scenarios. 

The Cyber Kill Chain: 

Developed by Lockheed Martin, the Cyber Kill Chain is a seven-step framework that 

outlines the lifecycle of a cyberattack, from preparation to execution. Here's what each 

phase means to a hacker: 

1. Reconnaissance

o Goal: Gather intelligence about your target. 

o Real-World Use: Use OSINT tools, scan networks, and map out vulnerabilities. 

o Tools: Nmap, Shodan, Maltego. 

2. Weaponization

o Goal: Craft your exploit. Combine malware with a delivery method. 

o Real-World Use: Write custom payloads or tweak existing ones to evade 

detection. 

o Tools: msfvenom, Veil, Python. 

3. Delivery

o Goal: Deliver the weapon to the target via phishing, USB drops, or direct access.
